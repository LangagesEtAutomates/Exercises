## Compilation

To build all exercise sheets (the TD booklet and all TP subjects):

```bash
make
```

This command produces:

```
docs/td.pdf
docs/tp-flex.pdf
docs/tp-cup.pdf
```

You can also compile a single document:

```bash
make td          # Builds the TD booklet (docs/td.pdf)
make flex        # Builds docs/tp-flex.pdf (other TP files can be built similarly)
make tp          # Builds all TP sheets
```

If you have access to the private  
[LangagesEtAutomates/Corrections](https://github.com/LangagesEtAutomates/Corrections) repository:

```bash
make correction  # Builds docs/td-correction.pdf
make both        # Builds both docs/td.pdf and docs/td-correction.pdf
```

The correction version includes hidden solutions and requires an SSH key with access to the private repo.

## Dependencies

The Makefile automatically manages required dependencies:

- [latex-libs](https://github.com/MatthieuPerrin/latex-libs) – cloned on first build (requires Internet only once).
- [Corrections](https://github.com/LangagesEtAutomates/Corrections) – optional private repo (for correction versions).

To update all dependencies:

```bash
make update
```
